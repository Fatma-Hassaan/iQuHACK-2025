# iQuHACK-2025
Key Functions:
  y_times_21_mod_143(qc, q[i]): A placeholder for the modular exponentiation part of Shor's algorithm. It should be defined to handle the modular operations necessary for the algorithm.
                                The implementation is based on eq(4) and Fig. 9 in the paper [1] for 8 bit factorization.
                                

  iqft_cct(qc, q, 7): A placeholder for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) implementation.
