# iQuHACK-2025
Key Functions:
y_times_21_mod_143(qc, q[i]): A placeholder for the modular exponentiation part of Shor's algorithm. It should be defined to handle the modular operations necessary for the algorithm.
iqft_cct(qc, q, 7): A placeholder for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) implementation. You can refer to earlier examples for the QFT implementation.
